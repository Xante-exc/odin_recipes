Hey!
I decided to change something in my life and now I'm taking a course on web development.
I chose Odin Project and this is very first project they want me to do.
The main reason behind this project is to practice my knowledge after learning basics of HTML and GIT.
This project is simple recipe card.

Added some css to my webpages. Some colors, margins, fonts-families. Simply put: Begginer Stuff. 

For this moment project is simpliefied (probably it will stay that way) and should't take serious for now.
