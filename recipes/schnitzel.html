    <h3>How to Make Pork Schnitzel:</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Trim pork chops of fat and slice into 1/2″-thick cutlets.</li>
        <li>Set up three bowls. In the first combine 1/3 cup flour, 1 Tbsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp pepper. In the second, use a fork to beat 3 eggs. In the third bowl, add 2 cups panko crumbs.</li>
        <li>Dredge both sides of each pounded cutlet in flour then dip in beaten egg letting excess egg drip back into the bowl before breading in panko crumbs. It helps to use a fork for the dipping process to keep your hands clean. Repeat with remaining cutlets.</li>
        <li>Fry your schnitzels on pan.</li>
    </ol>
